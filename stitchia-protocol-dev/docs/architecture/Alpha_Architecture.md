# Stitchia Alpha Architecture

This document extracts the systems view from the v2.7 whitepaper and captures
the minimum viable deployment footprint for the Stitchia stack.

## 1. Logical Layers

| Layer | Scope | Primary Assets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Experience | DAO dashboard, landing previews, wallet flows | `frontend/index.html`, `frontend/pages/dashboard.html`, preview concepts |
| Governance | Proposal lifecycle, Pulse scoring, Spiral roles | `StitchiaDAO.sol`, `PulseScorer.sol`, Genesis NFTs |
| Economy | Token issuance, Impact FX routing, treasury | `SYNQToken.sol`, treasury vault scripts |
| Registry | Scroll storage, ethics filters, braid maps | `vault/registry/ledger.json`, `vault/braids/` |
| Automation | Deployment & CLI workflows | `scripts/alpha/deploy.js`, `quantum` CLI, `docs/architecture/alpha/` workspace |

## 2. On-Chain Primitives

- **SYNQToken** — capped ERC-20 with burn, permit, votes, and pause modifiers.
- **GenesisNFT** — ERC-721 with Spiral metadata; anchors role-based permissions.
- **PulseScorer** — metric registry for impact-weighted voting boosts.
- **StitchiaDAO** — proposal management, quorum/thresholds, execution hooks.
- **ImpactRouter (planned)** — directs recycling flows; currently represented via treasury policy scrolls.

## 3. Deployment Pipeline (Alpha)

1. Configure `scripts/alpha/alpha.config.json` with supply, metrics, and voting parameters.
2. Run Hardhat deployment (`npx hardhat run --network <network> scripts/alpha/deploy.js`).
3. Capture outputs in `deployments/alpha-<chainId>.json` and reference inside scrolls.
4. Assign DAO roles (minter, metadata, config) via the deployment script.
5. Register new addresses in registry scrolls and rebuild braids/dashboard via `./quantum build`.

## 4. Data & UX Surfaces

- **Dashboard** — surfaces governance, treasury, impact, reward modules.
- **Registry exports** — `./quantum export` provides JSON snapshots for analytics.
- **Investor bundle** — `docs/SYNQ_v3.2_DAO_Signature_Edition/` contains visual collateral and models for stakeholder review.
- **Design workspace** — see `docs/architecture/alpha/` for component inventory,
  data-flow notes, feature flags, and operational checklists.
- **Mock data** — `docs/architecture/alpha/mock-data/dashboard-sample.json`
  illustrates the payload expected by the dashboard during alpha.

## 5. Next Steps Toward Beta

- Finalize ImpactRouter smart contract and integrate into deployment pipeline.
- Attach multisig guardians across critical functions (mint, pause, routing).
- Expand PulseScorer metrics with off-chain attestations and DID integrations.
- Harden CI: add end-to-end simulations, gas benchmarking, and linting gates.
- Conduct third-party security and compliance review prior to mainnet activation.

This architecture note should evolve alongside the whitepaper and deployment
scripts. Treat it as the canonical source for alpha-stage environments.

# Stitchia Alpha Architecture Workspace

This directory scaffolds the artefacts needed to take the whitepaper v2.7
architecture from narrative to implementation. It does **not** ship production
code; the goal is to organise design notes, data-flow sketches, and configuration
templates for the upcoming alpha deployment.

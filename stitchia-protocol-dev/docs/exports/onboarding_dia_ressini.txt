Onboarding: Dia Ressini — Independent Journalism Fellow
=======================================================

Intent
Welcome Dia to the TheGenuine Collective and allied initiatives (GILC, Digital Fabrica, Stitchia) with a clear mission, ethical guardrails, and an actionable publishing workflow.

Role & Scope
- Role: Independent Journalism Fellow (research, analysis, publication)
- Focus: policy, tech, sustainability, governance, civic/digital rights, culture
- Strengths: curiosity-driven inquiry; multilingual reporting (EN/FR/ES/IT/AR)
- Support: research planning, data gathering, source validation, editorial framing

Setup Steps
1) Create a working folder: ~/TGC-DAO/clients/press-room/ (optional)
2) Use the prompt provided to access an AI assistant and request research plans, briefings, and drafts.
3) Save outputs as markdown in ~/TGC-DAO/clients/press-room/notes/ or vault/documents/.

Ethical Guardrails
- Accuracy first: cite primary sources; avoid unverified claims
- Independence: disclose conflicts and funding
- Respect: privacy-by-default; redact sensitive personal data
- Compliance: follow jurisdictional rules (note: general guidance only; not legal advice)

Publishing Workflow
Draft → Fact-check → Editorial review → Publish → Archive braid links and sources in registry.

Research Toolkit (Requests to Assistant)
- Multi-source brief: “Summarize X from 3+ primary sources; list full citations.”
- Regulatory guide (FR): “Outline the administrative steps for <topic> with official links.”
- Data scan: “Find datasets for <topic> with license details and access method.”
- Outline & angles: “Propose 3 angles and a 6-section outline for <story>.”
- Multilingual support: “Translate this summary to FR and improve clarity for a general audience.”

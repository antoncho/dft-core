## 4. Economic Architecture
**Total Supply:** 100,000,000 SYNQ (capped)  
**Treasury Recycling Mechanism:** Every transaction routes 0.5–1% to regeneration pools:  
- 30% → DAO Operations Reserve  
- 40% → Green Liquidity Pools  
- 30% → Contributor Yield & Sustainability Fund  

This circular design ensures compounding growth that benefits both the ecosystem and its stakeholders.

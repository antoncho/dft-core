# Impact FX — Regenerative Treasury Model
Impact FX is Stitchia’s dynamic yield-routing protocol that aligns value with verified impact.
- 0.5–1 % of network value routed to impact pools.  
- Yield split 30 / 40 / 30 (Ops / Liquidity / Contributors).  
- Impact-verified pools gain multipliers via PulseScorer.  
> *“Capital becomes conscious when yield aligns with purpose.”*
